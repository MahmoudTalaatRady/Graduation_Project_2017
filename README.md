"Web Based Control of Multi-Agent Robotic System"

Abstract:
In this project, we develop a complete platform for coordination and control of multi-agent robotic system composed of a set of mobile robots that can be used to transport objects with different sizes and weights in an indoor environment. The main objective of the system is to use low-cost robots with limited capabilities and make them cooperate to perform complex tasks such as transportation of heavy objects that canâ€™t be transported by a single robot. As a proof of concept, the platform is applied to three omnidirectional mobile robots connected to the main server that assign tasks to them and coordinate their work to meet client requirements. A web-based interface is developed for clients to interact with the system.
